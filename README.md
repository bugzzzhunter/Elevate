The main window of app will provide with different options. Selecting an option will load a module for you to try your skills and techniques to perform LPE.

1. HackGUI - Abuse GUI to gain privileged access.
2. Weak File/Folder Permissions - If you have write permissions on newly created file/folder then get privileged access else try DOS.
3. Load DLL - Place you DLL properly to gain privileges.

There are more intentional bugs but you can ignore them and focus on the above listed ones.
